`SAL Final Project Data Scrape.ipynb`
This code will allow one to scrape the "team batting" table on baseball reference. 

Reformatting and reclassification of column data types is done for easier analysis.

Percentiles are calculated to allow for easier comparision. This is how the data was collected for the dashboard that we created.

`SAL Final Project Dashboard.ipynb`
Using the data gathered from the data scrape notebook, we then create a dashboard to allow for comparison of player stats to league averages. 
This code will allow users to create, run and view said dashboard.

All data is scraped from Baseball-Reference.com. The specific data used can be found in the team Standard Batting tables on Baseball-Reference.com and should be formatted accordingly.
